# MasterMind Game

Mastermind is a game where a computer creates a 4 digit  combination and the user has 10 tries to guess the combination. The user is also prompted with feedback such as when the user has used a correct digit in the combination and if that digit is in the correct place. Example the combination is "1536", if the user guesses "1458" then the computer would tell them "You have 2 correct numbers and 1 is in the correct place.". The user also has the ability to choose the difficulty in order to make it more exciting and difficult!
